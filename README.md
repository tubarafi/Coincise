# Coincise

Coincise is a web application that uses reinforcement machine learning to predict short-term price movements for cryptocurrencies. The application utilizes TensorFlow to create a deep recurrent Q-trading agent trained on GDAX data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Built with Flask, the investment management platform advises users on when to buy and sell their cryptocurrencies.
